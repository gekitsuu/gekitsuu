NAME
       gekitsuu - Adam Glenn, Senior Engineering Manager, Developer Experience

SYNOPSIS
       üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @gekitsuu.

ENVIRONMENTS I LIKE TO WORK IN
       ‚Ä¢ Home/Remote

       ‚Ä¢ The office when we can be together

       ‚Ä¢ Coffee shops

PREFERRED WORKING HOURS
       I  work  a  pretty strict 9-5 schedule but I do occasionaly make excep‚Äê
       tions.  Chances are if you try message me on  Slack  outside  of  those
       hours  I  won‚Äôt respond until the next day.  If you need to reach me in
       an emergency, you can always call my phone.  If I don‚Äôt pick up leave a
       message and I‚Äôll call you back.  SMS, Signal, and Telegram are all oth‚Äê
       er easy ways to reach me.

COMMUNICATION PREFERENCES
       Slack is the easiest way to reach me but I do check email once  a  day.
       SMS  won‚Äôt  ping me during work hours unless I add you to my allow list
       beforehand.  Paging me through Pager Duty will also come through if you
       can‚Äôt reach me by phone or Slack.

PREFERRED WAYS TO RECEIVE FEEDBACK
       I like to receive feedback on zoom or in person and as soon  as  possi‚Äê
       ble.

THINGS I NEED
       I  am someone who has ADHD and I‚Äôm on the Autistic spectrum.  I need to
       manage my sensory inputs sometimes.  This could mean I need alone/quiet
       space or I may use earplugs or headphones to make my envionrment  soft‚Äê
       er.  I‚Äôm usually pretty clear about when I need to step away but if you
       see  me  off  in the corner it‚Äôs probably me managing my sensory inputs
       and not that I‚Äôm anti-social by nature.

HOW I LEARN BEST
       I need some amount of time to do things  at  my  own  pace  before  I‚Äôm
       thrown into structured learning.  I usualy take time to research a top‚Äê
       ic  to a certain degree before I‚Äôm going to take training or a class so
       that I can more easliy follow the course material.  Sometimes I need to
       do things again and again so I gravitate towards video  based  instruc‚Äê
       tion so I can pause, take notes, rewind, rewatch sections, etc.

THINGS I STRUGGLE WITH
       Writing.   I have Dysgraphia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysgraphia)
       and it has a huge impact in how long it takes me to  write  things  and
       the quality of my writing.

THINGS I LOVE
       ‚Ä¢ Physical and Computer Security

       ‚Ä¢ Python

       ‚Ä¢ 3D Modeling with Blender

       ‚Ä¢ Learning new things

       ‚Ä¢ Teaching others about things I love

       ‚Ä¢ Prop making and 3D printing

       ‚Ä¢ Growing as a person

MY FAVORITE SAYING IS
              Talent  hits a target no one else can hit.  Genius hits a target
              no one else can see.  - Arthur Schopenhauer

OTHER THINGS I WANT YOU TO KNOW ABOUT ME
       ‚Ä¢ üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm interested in talking to other leaders about  leadership,  to
         become a better leader myself.
