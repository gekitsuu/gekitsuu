       I work a pretty strict 9-5 schedule but I do occasionaly make exceptions.
       Chances are if you try message me on Slack outside of those hours I won‚Äôt
       respond until the next day.  If you need to reach me in an emergency, you
       can always call my phone.  If I don‚Äôt pick up leave a message and I‚Äôll
       call you back.  SMS, Signal, and Telegram are all other easy ways to
       reach me.

       Slack is the easiest way to reach me but I do check email once a day.
       SMS won‚Äôt ping me during work hours unless I add you to my allow list
       beforehand.  Paging me through Pager Duty will also come through if you
       can‚Äôt reach me by phone or Slack.

       As someone with ADHD and on the Autistic spectrum, I need to manage my
       sensory inputs a bit.  Sometimes this means I need alone/quiet space or I
       may use earplugs or headphones to make my envionrment softer.

       I need some amount of time to do things at my own pace before I‚Äôm thrown
       into structured learning.  I usualy take time to research a topic to a
       certain degree before I‚Äôm going to take training or a class so that I can
       more easliy follow the course material.  Sometimes I need to do things
       again and again so I gravitate towards video based instruction so I can
       pause, take notes, rewind, rewatch sections, etc.

       Writing.  I have Dysgraphia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysgraphia)
       and it has a huge impact in how long it takes me to write things and the
       quality of my writing.
