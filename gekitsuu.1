gekitsuu - Adam Glenn, Senior Engineering Manager, Developer Experience
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\[u1F44B] Hi, I\[cq]m \[at]gekitsuu.
.SH ENVIRONMENTS I LIKE TO WORK IN
.IP \[bu] 2
Home/Remote
.IP \[bu] 2
The office when we can be together
.IP \[bu] 2
Coffee shops
.SH PREFERRED WORKING HOURS
.PP
I work a pretty strict 9-5 schedule but I do occasionaly make
exceptions.
Chances are if you try message me on Slack outside of those hours I
won\[cq]t respond until the next day.
If you need to reach me in an emergency, you can always call my phone.
If I don\[cq]t pick up leave a message and I\[cq]ll call you back.
SMS, Signal, and Telegram are all other easy ways to reach me.
.SH COMMUNICATION PREFERENCES
.PP
Slack is the easiest way to reach me but I do check email once a day.
SMS won\[cq]t ping me during work hours unless I add you to my allow
list beforehand.
Paging me through Pager Duty will also come through if you can\[cq]t
reach me by phone or Slack.
.SH PREFERRED WAYS TO RECEIVE FEEDBACK
.PP
I like to receive feedback on zoom or in person and as soon as possible.
.SH THINGS I NEED
.PP
I am someone who has ADHD and I\[cq]m on the Autistic spectrum.
I need to manage my sensory inputs sometimes.
This could mean I need alone/quiet space or I may use earplugs or
headphones to make my envionrment softer.
I\[cq]m usually pretty clear about when I need to step away but if you
see me off in the corner it\[cq]s probably me managing my sensory inputs
and not that I\[cq]m anti-social by nature.
.SH HOW I LEARN BEST
.PP
I need some amount of time to do things at my own pace before I\[cq]m
thrown into structured learning.
I usualy take time to research a topic to a certain degree before
I\[cq]m going to take training or a class so that I can more easliy
follow the course material.
Sometimes I need to do things again and again so I gravitate towards
video based instruction so I can pause, take notes, rewind, rewatch
sections, etc.
.SH THINGS I STRUGGLE WITH
.PP
Writing.
I have Dysgraphia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysgraphia) and it has
a huge impact in how long it takes me to write things and the quality of
my writing.
