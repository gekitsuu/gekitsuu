# NAME
gekitsuu - Adam Glenn, Senior Engineering Manager, Developer Experience

# SYNOPSIS

👋 Hi, I’m @gekitsuu. 

# ENVIRONMENTS I LIKE TO WORK IN

- Home/Remote
- The office when we can be together
- Coffee shops

# PREFERRED WORKING HOURS

I work a pretty strict 9-5 schedule but I do occasionaly make exceptions. Chances are if you try message me on Slack outside of those hours I won't respond until the next day. If you need to reach me in an emergency, you can always call my phone. If I don't pick up leave a message and I'll call you back. SMS, Signal, and Telegram are all other easy ways to reach me.

# COMMUNICATION PREFERENCES

Slack is the easiest way to reach me but I do check email once a day. SMS won't ping me during work hours unless I add you to my allow list beforehand. Paging me through Pager Duty will also come through if you can't reach me by phone or Slack.

# PREFERRED WAYS TO RECEIVE FEEDBACK

I like to receive feedback on zoom or in person and as soon as possible.

# THINGS I NEED

I am someone who has ADHD and I'm on the Autistic spectrum. I need to manage my sensory inputs sometimes. This could mean I need alone/quiet space or I may use earplugs or headphones to make my envionrment softer. I'm usually pretty clear about when I need to step away but if you see me off in the corner it's probably me managing my sensory inputs and not that I'm anti-social by nature. 

# HOW I LEARN BEST

I need some amount of time to do things at my own pace before I'm thrown into structured learning. I usualy take time to research a topic to a certain degree before I'm going to take training or a class so that I can more easliy follow the course material. Sometimes I need to do things again and again so I gravitate towards video based instruction so I can pause, take notes, rewind, rewatch sections, etc.

# THINGS I STRUGGLE WITH

Writing. I have [Dysgraphia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysgraphia) and it has a huge impact in how long it takes me to write things and the quality of my writing.

# THINGS I LOVE

- Physical and Computer Security
- Python
- 3D Modeling with Blender
- Learning new things
- Teaching others about things I love
- Prop making and 3D printing
- Growing as a person
